    "In this notebook, you'll:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Install [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Configure your API key to use the Gemini model\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first simple agent\n",
    "- ✅ Run your agent and watch it use a tool (like Google Search) to answer a question\n",

    "> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⏸️ **Note:**  When you first start the notebook via running a cell you might see a banner in the notebook header that reads **\"Waiting for the next available notebook\"**. The queue should drop rapidly; however, during peak bursts you might have to wait a few minutes.\n",

      "helpful_assistant > The Agent Development Kit (ADK) from Google is an open-source, flexible, and modular framework designed to simplify the creation, deployment, and orchestration of AI agents and multi-agent systems. It aims to make agent development more like traditional software development, allowing for robust debugging, versioning, and deployment. While optimized for Google's Gemini models and ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, ensuring compatibility with other frameworks and models.\n",

      "*   **Flexible Orchestration:** Supports deterministic workflows (sequential, parallel, loop) and dynamic routing via LLM-driven agents.\n",
      "*   **Modular Multi-Agent Architecture:** Enables the composition of specialized agents into hierarchies for scalable applications.\n",
      "*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Allows agents to utilize pre-built tools, custom functions, and integrate with third-party libraries or even other agents.\n",
      "*   **Code-First Development:** Developers define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in code for greater control and testability.\n",
      "*   **Deployment Ready:** Facilitates deployment across various environments, including Google Cloud services like Vertex AI Agent Engine Runtime.\n",
      "*   **Built-in Evaluation and Debugging:** Includes tools for evaluating agent performance and debugging development.\n",
